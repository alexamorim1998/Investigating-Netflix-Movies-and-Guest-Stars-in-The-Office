What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into the largest entertainment/media company by <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/netflix-shares-close-up-8-for-yet-another-record-high-2020-07-10\">market capitalization</a>, boasting over 200 million subscribers as of <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/netflix-tops-200-million-subscribers-but-faces-growing-challenge-from-disney-plus/\">January 2021</a>.</p>\n<p>Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex our data manipulation skills and dive into the entertainment industry. Our friend has also been brushing up on their Python skills and has taken a first crack at a CSV file containing Netflix data. For their first order of business, they have been performing some analyses, and they believe that the average duration of movies has been declining. </p>\n<p>As evidence of this, they have provided us with the following information. For the years from 2011 to 2020, the average movie durations are 103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, and 90, respectively.</p>\n<p>If we're going to be working with this data, we know a good place to start would be to probably start working with <code>pandas</code>.

A great place to start will be a visualization of the data.</p>\n<p>Given that the data is continuous, a line plot would be a good choice, with the dates represented along the x-axis and the average length in minutes along the y-axis.

Loading the rest of the data from a CSV\n<p>Well, it looks like there is something to the idea that movie lengths have decreased over the past ten years!

There are a few questions about this trend that we are currently unable to answer, including:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What does this trend look like over a longer period of time?</li>\n<li>Is this explainable by something like the genre of entertainment?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Upon asking our friend for the original CSV they used to perform their analyses, they gladly oblige and send it. We now have access to the CSV file, available at the path <code>\"datasets/netflix_data.csv\"</code>. Let's create another DataFrame, this time with all of the data.

Marking non-feature films\n<p>Interesting! It looks as though many of the films that are under 60 minutes fall into genres such as \"Children\", \"Stand-Up\", and \"Documentaries\". This is a logical result, as these types of films are probably often shorter than 90 minute Hollywood blockbuster. </p>\n<p>We could eliminate these rows from our DataFrame and plot the values again. But another interesting way to explore the effect of these genres on our data would be to plot them, but mark them with a different color.</p>\n<p>In Python, there are many ways to do this, but one fun way might be to use a loop to generate a list of colors based on the contents of the <code>genre</code> column. Much as we did in Intermediate Python, we can then pass this list to our plotting function in a later step to color all non-typical genres in a different color!</p>\n<p><em>Note: Although we are using the basic colors of red, blue, green, and black, <code>matplotlib</code> has many named colors you can use when creating plots.
